This image cropper javascript library is originally from:
  http://www.defusion.org.uk/code/javascript-image-cropper-ui-using-prototype-scriptaculous/

It is a repackaging of the 1.2.0 version (30th October 2006), where we just
  - copied the necessary files under our file structure
  - removed unneccessary files:
    - cropper.uncompressed.js
    - lib/controls.js
    - lib/effects.js
    - lib/slider.js
    - lib/unittest.js
    - tests/*
